# Amphibians App

This app retrieves amphibian data from the internet and displays it in a scrolling list.
The data is stored on a Web server as a REST web service.

It leverages modern Android development practices, including:
- Retrofit: For making network requests to the Amphibians API.
- Coil: For efficient image loading and displaying amphibian images.
- kotlinx.serialization: For parsing the JSON data returned by the API.
- Dependency Injection: Ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase
